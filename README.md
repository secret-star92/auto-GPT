Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by GPT-4, autonomously develops and manages businesses to increase net worth. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

### Demo (30/03/2023):

## üöÄ Features

- üåê Internet access for searches and information gathering
- üíæ Long-Term and Short-Term memory management
- üß† GPT-4 instances for text generation
- üîó Access to popular websites and platforms
- üóÉÔ∏è File storage and summarization with GPT-3.5

## üìã Requirements
- [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-python-in-windows)
- OpenAI API key

Optional:
- ElevenLabs Key (If you want the AI to speak)

## üíæ Installation

To install Auto-GPT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
$ cd 'Auto-GPT/scripts'
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Edit the file named "keys.py" in the "scripts" directory to add your OpenAI API key (and eleven labs key if you want speech):


## üîß Usage

1. Run the Python script in your terminal:
```
python main.py
```
2. After each of AUTO-GPT's actions, type "NEXT COMMAND" to authorise them to continue.
3. To exit the program, type "exit" and press Enter.

## üíÄ Continuous Mode ‚ö†Ô∏è
Run the AI **without** user authorisation, 100% automated.
Continuous mode is not recommended. 
It is potentially dangerous and may cause your AI to run forever or carry out actions you would not usually authorise. 
Use at your own risk.

1. Run the Python script in your terminal:
```
python main.py continuous-mode
```
2. To exit the program, press Ctrl + C

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
This experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:

1. Not a polished application or product, just an experiment
2. May not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!
3. Quite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!
